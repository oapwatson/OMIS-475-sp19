                                   So, one of my favorite movies of all time is probably Hacksaw Ridge. 
                                It’s the story of Pfc Desmond Doss who won the Congressional Medal of Honor during WW2. 
                                He had a hard early life which led to his decision to be a conscientious objector to WW2 
                                based on religious grounds and refused to fire a weapon during the war. Because of this, he 
                                was made a medic and saved many people behind enemy lines. It’s a fantastic movie that 
                                everyone should watch.
