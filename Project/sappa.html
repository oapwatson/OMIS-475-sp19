                              I
                            I used SAP Predictive Analytics heavily in a couple different classes. The first time I used it was in a business intelligence class where we went throught the basics of this powerful tool and eventually started to do some
                            statistical anlysis and modeling with it. I thought it was a very interesting tool. After I learned that, I used this tool in another class where we given a dataset by a company and we were told to analyze the data. We were 
                            given the option of any tool we wanted, but I chose this one becuase I thought it was very useful for the job.
