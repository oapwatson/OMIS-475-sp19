<dt><strong>Self Titled</strong></dt>
    <dd>This is the first album to the heavy metal group. In this album they were heavily influenced by earlier metal bands, rap artists, and jazz as well. It is my favorite album to this day.</dd>
    
    <dt><strong>Iowa</strong></dt>
    <dd>In this album, they had to follow up on the success of their first. Although this one was not as popular as the first, it is still very good.This is probably their mnost true to their genre album that they have put out and was very dark as well.</dd>
    <dt><strong>Volume 3</strong></dt>
    <dd> This was a commercially successful album due to its radio friendly nature. They wanted to make music that could be played on the radio in this album to increase sales. Although it might sound like it is not true to themselves, it still had very good music on it.</dd>
